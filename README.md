About: AlchemVR is a virtual lab experience in which the user is scored on basic chemistry lab profieciency in a Dilution Lab with HCL and water. The user enters their name and ID to begin their expiriment. The user is then assesed on how well they follow the procedure and how well they understood the lab by answering the questions once the expiriment is complete. The results are then sent to a google sheet which is searchable for the teacher to locate the results of each student by searching for ID.
